# 🎨 Artists Against Taupe

**Artists Against Taupe** is a community-driven project dedicated to transforming dull, institutional spaces into vibrant, inspiring environments through art and color. Starting at the YMCA Safe Place Shelter in Louisville, KY, this initiative aims to bring joy, creativity, and hope to spaces that need it most.

## 🌟 About the Project  

Founded and led by artist **Tiffany Ackerman**, the project reimagines blank and uninspired spaces, replacing taupe walls with murals, installations, and color that reflect the care and creativity of the community. It serves as both a model and inspiration for other public spaces to embrace the transformative power of art.
