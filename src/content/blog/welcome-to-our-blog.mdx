# Welcome to Our Blog!

We're excited to launch the Artists Against Taupe blog, a new space where we'll share:

- **Artist Spotlights** - Get to know the amazing artists transforming institutional spaces
- **Project Updates** - Follow along as we bring color to new locations
- **Behind the Scenes** - See how murals come to life
- **Community Stories** - Hear from the people impacted by our work

## Why We're Starting This Blog

After years of transforming spaces and touching lives, we realized we needed a better way to share these incredible stories. This blog will be our canvas for documenting the journey of turning institutional beige into vibrant, healing environments.

### What to Expect

Every month, we'll feature:
1. A new artist profile
2. Progress updates from ongoing projects
3. Tips for organizations wanting to transform their spaces
4. Stories from the youth and communities we serve

## Get Involved

Want to contribute to the blog? We're always looking for:
- Guest posts from artists
- Photo submissions from transformed spaces
- Stories from those who've been impacted by colorful environments

Contact us at [contact@artistsagainsttaupe.com](mailto:contact@artistsagainsttaupe.com) to share your story.
