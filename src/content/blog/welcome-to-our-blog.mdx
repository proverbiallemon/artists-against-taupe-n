# Starting a Blog

We're heading to Focus 2025 in a couple weeks (July 21-24) and figured it would be good to have a place to share some photos and updates from the conference.

## What's Focus 2025?

It's the National Safe Place Network's conference at Disney's Coronado Springs Resort. A week-long event where Safe Place folks from around the country meet up.

## Who's Going

Three artists from our group will be there:
- Tiffany Ackerman (Artists Against Taupe founder)
- Aril Ferrara 
- Hannah Fitzgerald

## What to Expect

I'll post occasional updates during the trip - some photos, maybe some notes from sessions, general conference stuff. Nothing too structured, just documenting the experience.

The blog might evolve into something more later, but for now it's mainly for sharing Focus 2025 updates.
